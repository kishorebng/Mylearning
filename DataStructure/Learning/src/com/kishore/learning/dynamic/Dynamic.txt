Two major properties of Dynamic programming

To decide whether problem can be solved by applying Dynamic programming we check for two properties. 

If problem has these two properties then we can solve that problem using Dynamic programming.

   1) Overlapping Subproblems
   2) Optimal Substructure.
   
  Overlapping Subproblems:

          Overlapping subproblems, as the name suggests the subproblems needs to be solved again and again. 
          In recursion we solve those problems every time and in dynamic programming we solve these sub problems only once and store it for future use.
          
  Optimal Substructure: 
          
          If a problem can be solved by using the solutions of the sub problems then we say that problem has a Optimal Substructure Property.
          
  
  Dynamic Programming Approaches:

     Bottom-Up
     Top-Down

   Bottom-Up Approach:

         Suppose we need to solve the problem for N, We start solving the problem with the smallest possible inputs and store it for future. 
         Now as you calculate for the bigger values use the stored solutions      
   
   Top-Down Approach:

         Break the problem into sub-problems and solve them as needed and store the solution for future.
